    "Your application must support the following functionalities, each of which is to be implemented as SQL or PL/pgSQL routine (*i.e.,* function or procedure).\n",
    "Some of these routines return a JSON value.\n",
    "PostgreSQL provides many useful functions for JSON data type (*e.g.,* [row to JSON](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-json.html), [JSON aggregate](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/functions-aggregate.html)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the specification for the routines are *incomplete* by design.\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The data types for the input parameters are not specified.\n",
    "* Certain parameters are not explicitly defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any criterion/process/design issues that are not explicitly stated, you are free to decide on how to address that issue in a reasonable way and justify your decisions in your project report.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `add_employee`:\n",
    "    This routine is used to add a new employee.\n",
    "    The inputs to this routine includes at least the following:\n",
    "    * name\n",
    "    * contact number\n",
    "    * department\n",
    "    * kind (this is either junior, senior or manager)\n",
    "    * manager (may be `NULL`)\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The employee ID and email address is automatically generated by the system.\n",
    "2. `remove_employee`:\n",
    "    This routine is used to remove an employee.\n",
    "    The inputs to this routine includes at least the following:\n",
    "    * employee ID\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As before, if the employee is a manager, then we assign all employees supervised by this manager into a dummy manager.\n",
    "    The employee should also be removed from all future meetings."
