    "This deliverable is due on **Week 12** Saturday, 6 November 2021 (*23:59*).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Submit your project deliverables by creating a **local** directory (*i.e.,* in your computer) named `teamNN` (*where `NN` is your team number*) with the following four files:\n",
    "    1. `report.pdf`: Project report in PDF format.\n",
    "    2. `schema.sql`: SQL commands to create your application's database schema.\n",
    "    3. `data.sql`: SQL commands to load data into your application's database.\n",
    "    4. `proc.sql`: SQL or PL/pgSQL routines of your implementation.\n",
    "* It is important that your submission files are named as indicated above and that you have tested your code using `psql`.\n",
    "    * Marks will be deducted if any of your file cannot be run on `psql` in the correct order (*i.e.,* `schema.sql` followed by `data.sql` followed by `proc.sql`).\n",
    "* Compress the directory into a zip file named `teamNN.zip`.\n",
    "* Upload the zip file into LumiNUS file folder for your team.\n",
    "\n",
    "For late submissions, 5 marks will be deducted for each late day up to two late days.\n",
    "Project submitted after the second late day will receive zero marks and will not be graded."
