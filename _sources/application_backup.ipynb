    "\n",
    "Your company is a very large company with many employees and many meeting rooms available.\n",
    "For simplicity, the company is located at a single building.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, with the current pandemic, the meeting rooms cannot be easily used and bookings must be done before any employee can come to office and use the meeting room.\n",
    "Due to interdependence of the components here, you are advised to read everything first before you start to design your ER diagram.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may want to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify all the constraints as clearly as possible.\n",
    "2. Satisfy as many constraints as possible using ER diagram but you may have to identify constraints that can not be enforced.\n",
    "    * It's okay not to enforce everything as long as you are clear which are not enforced.\n",
    "    * You may have to enforce this using triggers.\n",
    "    * Since you have not learnt triggers yet, you should at least recognize the constraints that are not currently enforced by your ER diagram so that you can enforce it later.\n",
    "3. Draw the ER diagram and simulate the possibilities of violating the constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that the specifications are not formal to mimic a specification that is drafted by people who are not familiar with any database systems.\n",
    "As such, you are to fill in the informal or ambiguous specification with reasonable real-world constraints.\n",
    "Of course, in real-life, you have to ask for clarification about the project but in this project, you are given some flexibility to set your own constraints as long as they are reasonable."

    "For obvious reason, each meeting room can only be booked by one group.\n",
    "\n",
    "The steps for booking is described as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A senior employee or a manager books a room by specifying the room and the session.\n",
    "    * If the room is not available for the given session, no booking can be done. \n",
    "    * If the employee is having a fever, they cannot book any room.\n",
    "2. They then add the participants (*i.e.,* employees) to the booked room up to a maximum of the capacity of the room.\n",
    "    * The employee booking the room is also counted as a participant and should be counted towards the number of people in the room.\n",
    "    * If any of the participants are having a fever, they cannot be added.\n",
    "3. A manager from the same department approves the booking.\n",
    "    * A manager may approve their own booking.\n",
    "    * A booking that is not approved are immediately deleted to allow for other people to book the room.\n",
    "    * For simplicity, once approved, we assume there are no changes in the participants and they will definitely come to the meeting room on the stipulated day."
