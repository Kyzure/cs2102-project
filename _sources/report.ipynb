    "\n",
    "Each team is required to submit a project report as part of the project deliverables (due on **Week 12** Saturday, 6 November 2021 (*23:59*)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The project report (*up to a maximum of 20 pages **including appendix** in pdf format with at least 10-point font size*) should include the following contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Names and student numbers of all team members and project team number (*on the first page*).\n",
    "2. A listing of the project responsibilities of each team member.\n",
    "    * Team members who did not contribute a fair share of the project work will not receive the same marks awarded to the team.\n",
    "3. The ER data model for your application.\n",
    "    * If your ER model is too large (*i.e.,* spanning more than one page), you may want to include a single-page simplified ER model (*with non-key attributes omitted*) before presenting the detailed ER model.\n",
    "    * Provide justification for any non-trivial design decisions made in your ER model.\n",
    "    * List down 5 of the application's constraints that are not captured by the proposed ER date model.\n",
    "4. Relational database schema.\n",
    "    * Provide justification for any non-trivial design decisions made in your relational database schema.\n",
    "    * List down 5 of the application's constraints that are not captured by the proposed relational schema.\n",
    "        * *i.e.,* the constraints that are to be enforced using triggers.\n",
    "5. A description of the three most interesting triggers implemented for the application.\n",
    "    * Provide the name of the trigger.\n",
    "    * Explain the usage of the trigger.\n",
    "    * Justify the design of the trigger implementation.\n",
    "6. An analysis of normal forms of your relational database schema (*not your ER data model*).\n",
    "    * For each table R in your database that is not in 3NF:\n",
    "        * Find a dependency-preserving BCNF decomposition of R if it exists.\n",
    "        * Otherwise, find a 3NF decomposition of R.\n",
    "7. A reflection.\n",
    "    * Summary of any difficulties encountered and lessons learned from the project."
